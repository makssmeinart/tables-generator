# Tables Generator

A flexible table generator built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. This project provides an easy-to-use interface for dynamically generating tables with customizable columns. Some of the shared components are inspired by Chakra UI, but with an emphasis on simplicity and avoiding unnecessary complexity ( yeah... maybe not ). The goal was to use as few external libraries as possible while still providing a highly extensible and flexible grid.

## Features

- **Customizable Columns**: Dynamically create tables with user-defined columns.
- **Copy Grid**: Duplicate an existing grid and its data.
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Reorder rows and columns easily through drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Built with as few external libraries as possible to keep the project lightweight and easy to maintain.
- **Extensible Components**: Designed with flexibility in mind, allowing you to easily extend or modify the table functionality.
